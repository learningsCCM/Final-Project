# Final-Project

<b>Project Concept Summary</b>
For my final project I selected to do data analysis for a fictitious client, Kevin Smart, that is opening a small bookstore, Smart-Books. The client would like recommendations on books he must absolutely invest in for his initial inventory. Questions being considered:

    1.	What books make the rankings over several years?
    2.	Authors with the highest counts of books in top 50 over the years and whether they are fiction or non-fiction books
    3.	What are the top 5 books in fiction and non-fiction genre based on highest number or rating and user reviews for each year?
    4.	Does cost of book influence their popularity?
    5.	Does the number of pages influence book popularity?

<b>Tools Used</b>
Two Datasets used – Book reviews/ratings from Kaggle:
    o	Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books 2009 - 2019 (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sootersaalu/amazon-top-50-bestselling-books-2009-2019/data)
    o	Goodreads-books (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks/data)
<b>Other Tools Used</b>
    •	Excel – Initial peek at the data and some column shift adjustments
    •	Python 3 through Jupyter Notebooks
    •	Libraries used: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
    •	ChatGPT’s quick guidance / Google searches
